/**
 * A PhiReturnStmt is placed at the return site of a subroutine. This is
 * necessary because variables that are not referrenced inside a subroutine
 * (finally block) retain their value. This is a problem for SSA when a variable
 * is assigned to inside an exception handler. At the beginning of the finally
 * block, there would be a merge of two occurrences of the variable (one from
 * the the exception handler and another from the "outside world") and a phi
 * function should be placed accordingly. If the type of the variable was
 * changed inside the exception handler, the operands of phi function would be
 * of different types and that would be bad. To avoid this situation
 * PhiReturnStmt are placed before the next instruction to be executed after the
 * subroutine has returned. Note that each PhiReturnStmt has only one operand
 * that is the same variable as its target. The two variables will have
 * different version numbers, however.
 * <p>
 * The following diagram demonstrates PhiReturnStmt:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *                            a1 = 1   a2 = 2
 *                            b1 = 1   b2 = 2
 *                              jsr     jsr
 *                                \     /
 *                                 \   /
 *                                  \ /
 *                                   *
 *                         a3 = PhiJoinStmt(a1, a2)
 *                         b3 = PhiJoinStmt(b1, b2)
 *                                   |
 *                                b4 = 4  // b is defined in subrountine
 *                                   |
 *                                  ret
 *                                   *
 *                                  / \
 *                                 /   \
 *                                /     \
 *                               /       \
 *              a4 = PhiReturnStmt(a3)  a5 = PhiReturnStmt(a3)
 *              b5 = PhiReturnStmt(b4)  b6 = PhiReturnStmt(b4)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * After transformation, the PhiReturnStmts will become
 * 
 * <pre>
 *                       a1                    a2
 *                       b4                    b4
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The variable <tt>a</tt> is not modified in the subroutine, so it retains
 * its value from before the jsr. The variable <tt>b</tt> is modified in the
 * subroutine, so its value after the ret is the value it was assigned in the
 * subroutine.
